# Material-Science and Machine Learning

Simulation and optimization algorithms enjoy a great popularity in many fields, such as aerospace, material-science and engineering, just to name a few examples. Especially in material-science, machine learning contains a wide range of applications. With machine learning it was possible to discover new solar light absorbers [Bei et al., 2018] as well as new metallic glasses [Ren et al., 2018] or to optimize the fabrication of laser-induced graphene [Kotthoï¿½ et al., 2019]. In material sciences one is often facing the challenge of optimizing black-box functions with an input-output relation. Input parameters can be chemical structure, composition or processing conditions and the output is defined by the quality of the resulting material [Wang et al., 2018]. As the evaluation of such experiments is labor-intensive, time-consuming and related to high cost, we are interested in achieving the best results with the lowest number of evaluation. While human experts developed and explored these parameter settings based on literature or on chemical and physical laws in the past, machine learning nowadays is able to achieve better results than human experts. The general approach of model-based optimization is the simulation of input-output relation with so called surrogate models. Thereafter, the next promising points are proposed with an iterative model-based approach. This procedure enables researchers to improve their choices which parameter settings to test next.
